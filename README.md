Hope you will find this site and this project useful =)) 
I will leave all links on every node that I use and maybe it will make it easier for you to find and download the necessary packages! 
All files that I provided in the Project you can download *(Its going to be in ZIP format)*
Interesting information: I deleted some of the history from GitHub because the repository size became more than 800 MB, and the only option I had was to delete the file from all actions, history, and the repository
